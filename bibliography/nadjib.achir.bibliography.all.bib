abstract="The objective of this work is to propose an architectural solution to achieve an efficient, distributed control and management of DiffServ enabled networks. DiffServ offers a scalable QoS provisioning solution but it introduces a certain amount of complexity in terms of management and control. The proposed solution is an alternative to the client/server policy-based approach put forward by the IETF1, which assumes that complete predefined instrumentation is already implemented in DiffServ nodes. In this work, we suppose that DiffServ nodes offer an API with a minimum number of control functions. Based on this assumption, the proposed solution introduces a new control architecture to configure and control these nodes in a customized and flexible manner.",

abstract="This paper focus on optimal Call Admission Control (CAC) policy for an IEEE 802.16 Wireless MAN. This policy has two objectives: (i) statistically guarantee the QoS of UGS, rtPS and nrtPS connections, (ii) maximize the average revenue of the wireless link. To find such optimal policy, we model our CAC agent as a Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Process (CSMDP). To the best of our knowledge, the only algorithm able to compute the optimal control policy of a CSMDP is based on the Linear Programming (L.P.) approach. Unfortunately, a realistic CAC problem with a large states space is intractable with the L.P. algorithm. Our work presents two contributions. First, the proposition of an optimal CAC for Triple-Play services support over a 802.16 WMAN. Second, the presentation of an alternative iterative algorithm that can be used to overcome the difficulties faced by the L.P. approach.",
